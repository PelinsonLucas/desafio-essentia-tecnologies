# Task Management

This Project represents an API for a To-do-list app developed as a challenge to essentia tecnologies. It was created using Nestjs, node and typescript. It connects to a mysql database and provides with functions for task creation, retrieve, update, and deletion.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install
```
You also need to make sure that the mysql server is correctly configured in the app.module.ts file.
To define the mysql credentials, you can create a .env file with the following variables:
```bash
DATABASE_USER=<your username>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your password>
```
## Running the app

After executing the previous steps, you can start the api server by running the following command
```bash
# development
$ npm run start
```

Then, the api server should be running!
